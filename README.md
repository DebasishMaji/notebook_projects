# Notebook Projects


Deep learning projects to understand the neural network concept, implement neural network and improve the performance of our result.

   1. [Initialization](/Initialization.ipynb)
        
         In this notebook project we will:
         
         - Understand that different initialization methods and their impact on our model performance

         - Implement zero initialization and and see it fails to "break symmetry",

         - Recognize that random initialization "breaks symmetry" and yields more efficient models,

         - Understand that we could use both random initialization and scaling to get even better training performance on our model.

          

   2. [Regularization](/Regularization+-+v2.ipynb)
   
        In this notebook project we will:
        
        - Understand that different regularization methods that could help our model.

        - Implement dropout and see it work on data.

        - Recognize that a model without regularization gives us a better accuracy on the training set but nor necessarily on the test set.

        - Understand that we could use both dropout and regularization on our model.


   3. [Optimization](/Optimization+methods.ipynb)
   
       In this notebook project we will:
       
       - Understand the intuition between Adam and RMS prop

       - Recognize the importance of mini-batch gradient descent

       - Learn the effects of momentum on the overall performance of our model
   
   4. [Gradient Checking](/Gradient+Checking+v1.ipynb)
       
       In this notebook project we will:
       
       - Implement gradient checking from scratch.

       - Understand how to use the difference formula to check our backpropagation implementation.

       - Recognize that our backpropagation algorithm should give us similar results as the ones we got by computing the difference formula.

       - Learn how to identify which parameter's gradient was computed incorrectly.
   
   5. [Tensorflow](/Tensorflow+Tutorial.ipynb)

       - In this notebook we will learn all the basics of Tensorflow. 
       - We will implement useful functions and draw the parallel with what we did using Numpy. 
       - We will understand what Tensors and operations are, as well as how to execute them in a computation graph.
